**Core** :
	1.  Entry
	2. Output
	3. Loaders
	4. Plugins
	5. Mode
	6. Browser Compatibility

### 1. Entry
- Usages: ```entry: string| [string] ```
```
- An **entry point** indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph.
- default value **./src/index.js** 
- we can specify different (or multiple ) entry points by setting and entry property in webpack configuration.
``` webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
	entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js'
}
```

##### **Single Entry Syntax**
```webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
	entry : {
		main: './path/to/entry/file.js'
	}
}

// shorthand
module.exports = {
	entry: './path/to/entry/file.js'
}
```

##### Multi Entry Syntax
```webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
	entry: ['./src/file_1.js','./src/file_2.js']
}
```
- **Multi Main Entry** injects multiple dependent files together and graph their dependencies into one "chunk".

#### Object Syntax
- Usage: ```entry: { <entryChunkName> string | [string] } | {}```
``` webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
	entry: {
		app: './src/app.js',
		adminApp:'./src/adminApp.js'
	}
}
```
- This is the most scalable way of defining entry/entries in application.
- Scalable webpack configs are ones that can be reused and combined with other partial configs.
- This is a popular technique used to separate concerns by enviornment, build target and runtime. They are the merged using specialized tools like **webpack-merge**
- **NOTE** We can pass emptyObject { }  to entry when we have only entry points generated by plugins.

#### EntryDescription Object
- An object of entry point description. We can specify the following properties:
	- **dependOn** ; 
		- The entry points that the current entry point depedns on.
		- They must be loaded before the entry point is loaded.
	- **filename** ;
		- Specifies the name of each output file on disk
	- **import** ; 
		- Module(s) that are loaded upon startup
	- **library** ;
		- Specify library options to bundle a library from current entry
	- **runtime**;
		- name of runtime chunk
		- can be set to false.
	- **publicPath**;
		- Specify public url address for output files for this entry when they are referenced in a browser.
``` webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
	entry: {
		a : 'dependingfile.js',
		b: {
			dependOn:'a',
			import: './src/app.js'
		}
	}
}
```
- **NOTE**: 
	- runtime & dependOn should not be used together on a single entry.
	- runtime must not point to an existing entry point name.
	- dependOn must not be circular


### 2. Output
- Output tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files.
- default value **'./dist/main.js'** for main output file
- **./dist** folder for any other generated file.
- we can configure this as well.
``` webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
	output: {
		path: path.resolve(__diranme,'dist'),
		filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'		
	}
}
```
- There can be only one output config.
#### Single Entry
```webpack.config.js
- 
```

#### 3. Loaders
- Webpack only understands JS and JSON files.
- Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules.
- Those modules are consumes by the application and added to dependency graph.
- Loader have two properties in webpack config:
	1. **test** , it identifies which file(s) should be transformed.
	2. **use**, it indicates which loader should be used to do the transforming.
``` webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	output: {
		filename : 'my-first-webpack.bundle..js'
	},
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader'
			}
		]
	}
}
```

- Config above has defined a rules property for a single module with two required properties.
- This tells webpack when it comes across a path the resolved to a '.txt' file inside of a require/import statement. use **raw-loader** to transform it before adding it to the bundle.

#### 4. Plugins
- Plugins perform tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.
``` webpack.config.js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './src/index.html' })],
};
```
- Here html-webpack-plugin generates a HTML file for the application and automatically injects all the generated bundles into this file.

#### 5. Mode
- **Mode** parameter enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment.
- default value is **production**
``` webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
	mode: 'production' | 'development' | 'none'
}
```
